## üß∞ I WORK USING

Durig my daily code routine (for work or study) I use a couple lenguages and tools, see bellow.

- **Swift** and **Objective-C** to develop and maintain the product.
- **UIKit** and **SwiftUI** frameworks with **Core animation* to create pretty users interfaces reponsables and acessibles improving the appstore application rate.
- **Native URLSession**, **Alamofire**, **Apolo** and/or **Trust** to comunicate the application with the backend.
- **CGD** to improve performance of the application on handeling the datas
- **Core data** to store massive datas in devices faster and reliable.
- **Keychain** to store sessive datas like credential avoiding security weaknesses.
- **User Default** to store the basic prefence data to improve the experience of user.
- **Architectural UI patterns** like **MVC**, **MVVM-C**, **Composable Architecture**, **VIP** or **VIPER**.
- **Combine** or **RXSwift** to handle the datas that transaction in the application to became more flexible and reative.
- **CocoaPods** and **SPM (Swift Package Manager)** to manage the application dependencies.
- **SwiftLint** and **SwiftFormat** to improve development guideline. This became more easily the maintenance of codebase and your **Continuos Integration (CI)**.
- **Fastlane** to automate the process of to deleiver the app to the **TestFlight** and **AppStore** saving a several time to deploy a new version (CD).
- Other frameworks that I have experice to use to access native resoruce is **Core Location**, **Core Bluetooth**, **HealthKit**, **AVFoundation** and **StoreKie**.
